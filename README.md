# Spider Robot – Arduino Robotics Project

# Overview:

This project is a 4-legged spider robot built using Arduino Uno and the PCA9685 16-channel servo driver.
The robot demonstrates leg movement control, servo coordination, and basic walking algorithms.

The goal of the project was to build and program a functional robotics prototype and document the entire process.

# Features:

- 4-leg robot with 12 servo motors

- PCA9685 servo controller

- Arduino-based control

- Modular movement functions (stand, move forward, leg test)

- Upgraded wiring for stable power delivery

# Components Used:

- Arduino Uno

- 8.4V external power supply (2 batteries)

- XL4015 DC-DC adjustable voltage stepper with digital display

- PCA9685 16-channel driver

- SG90 servos (12 pieces)

- Custom robot frame (3D printed)

- Bluetooth module HC - 05

- Jumper wires
